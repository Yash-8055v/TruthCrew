🛡️ TruthCrew

Awareness before amplification.

TruthCrew is a frontend-focused, AI-assisted misinformation awareness platform designed to help users pause, think, and verify information before sharing it—especially during sensitive and high-impact situations.

रुकें। सोचें। जाँचें।

🚀 Overview

In today’s fast-moving digital world, misinformation spreads faster than verified facts. During emergencies or viral moments, unverified news and AI-generated images can cause panic, confusion, and real-world harm.

TruthCrew addresses this problem by providing a calm, ethical, and user-centric verification experience.
The platform does not claim to determine absolute truth. Instead, it assists users by presenting verification status, contextual explanations, and visual indicators to support responsible decision-making.
